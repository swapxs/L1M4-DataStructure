Write a program that solves the following problem using golang:

Three missionaries and three cannibals come to a river and find a boat that
holds two people. Everyone must get across the river to continue on the
journey. However, if the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either
bank, the missionaries will be eaten. Find a series of crossings that will get
everyone safely to the other side of the river.
